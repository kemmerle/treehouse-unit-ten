# School Database (Project 10 for the Treehouse Apprenticeship Program--TAP)

## A Full Stack Application with React and a REST API created with Express and Sequelize

## Overview of the REST API

The following starter files were supplied by Team Treehouse:

* The `seed` folder contains a starting set of data for the database in the form of a JSON file (`data.json`) and a collection of files (`context.js`, `database.js`, and `index.js`) that can be used to create the app's database and populate it with data.
* A `.gitignore` file to ensure that the `node_modules` folder doesn't get pushed to any GitHub repo.
* The `app.js` file configures Express to serve a simple REST API.
* The `nodemon.js` file configures the nodemon Node.js module, which I am using to run your REST API.
* The `package.json` file (and the associated `package-lock.json` file) contain the project's npm configuration, which includes the project's dependencies.
* The `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file is a collection of Postman requests that you can use to test and explore the REST API.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the 'api'
folder located at root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```
Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

You can leave the API running in the background while you test the React application.

## Overview of the React Application

The following starter files were supplied by Team Treehouse:

* The markup folder contains a collection of HTML files that show how each page in the app should be structured.
* The styles/global.css file contains all the styles needed for this project.
* The mockups folder contains a collection of PNG image files showing how each page should look with the provided HTML and CSS applied.
